Description

InFlight is a simple taxi flight timer mod that lets you know how long it will take to get to your destination. Other mods may provide a similar feature, however, InFlight is a lightweight alternative that, in most cases, is leaner, faster and uses a lot less memory (which is the main motivation behind InFlight).
Features:

    Take-off confirmation
    Many customization options for the look of the timer bar
    Support for Druid-only and some other special flight paths
    Already has most flight times
    Learns new flight times or updates existing flight times when taxis are used
    Flight times added to tooltip on flight map

How to Use:

    InFlight is LoadOnDemand to use less memory when not needed
    '/inflight', right-click on the timer bar, or check interface options to customize
    Shift left-click and drag to move the timer bar

How to Contribute:

    Updating flight times data - submit the file '<WoW_Folder>/_retail_/WTF/Account/<Account_Name>/SavedVariables/InFlight.lua'
    Updating detection of special flights (only repeatable ones): report the gossip text (text you click to start the flight) and the location text above your minimap
    Updating or adding translations for a language

Features That Won't Be Implemented, So Don't Ask:

    Detailed tooltips and connect-the-dots
    Show known/unknown Flight Masters on map
